During our search, we were delighted to find The Conversations Gone Awry Corpus.</p><p>The corpus is a collection of arguments between Wikipedia editors, that occurred sometime arround 2017. It is annotated with toxicity scores and personal attacks.</p><p>We liked this dataset so much we created a 3d graph visualizer that shows the argumenmts grouped into topics that can be analyzed.</p><p>...Or just paste or type your own conversation gone awry HERE to get helpful feedback!</p><p>As it turns out, in Chinese the word "ming" means LIGHT, but can also mean CLEAR, perhaps somewhat similar to the english word ELUCIDATE.</p><p>Since, shedding light on difficult arguments is what hoped to achieve with this project, we thought the name Ming was a perfect choice!</p><p>Welcome to the <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size:36px">æ˜ŽðŸ§ </span>!!!</p>'
